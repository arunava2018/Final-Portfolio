            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a dedicated and enthusiastic 3rd-year undergraduate student with a passion
                for Competitive Programming and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). Throughout my academic journey, I've
                delved into the intricacies of problem-solving and algorithmic challenges, honing my skills to tackle
                real-world coding scenarios.While my heart lies in the world of Competitive Programming, I'm also
                venturing into the realm of Web
                Development. As a beginner, I'm excited to explore and learn the ropes of creating dynamic and
                interactive web applications. My curiosity drives me to embrace new technologies and methodologies, and
                I'm eager to share my journey and projects with you.
                Join me on this exciting journey as I balance the precision of algorithms with the creativity of web
                development. Feel free to explore my projects, get to know my coding style, and connect with me. Let's
                build something extraordinary together!"
